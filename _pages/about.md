# About Me

Hello! This is Benyun Zhao (赵犇赟). I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of [Mechanical and Automation Engineering](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), where I obtained my Master's degree in 2021. I am now a member of [Unmanned System Research (USR) group](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/) and [Hong Kong Centre for Logistics Robotics (HKCLR)](https://www.hkclr.hk/), supervised by [*Prof. Ben M. Chen*](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/chen-benmei/) and frequently collaborating with [*Prof. Yunhui Liu*](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/liu-yun-hui/) in CUHK and [*Prof. Mark W. Mueller*](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/mark-w-mueller/) in UC, Berkeley. My work focuses on engineer applications of computer vision based on unmanned systems, such as object detection and segmentation, VLM deployment, image enhancement, 3D scene reconstruction and understanding.
